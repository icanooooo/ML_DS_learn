# Data Analysis and Machine Learning

This is my repo for learning Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Currently I mainly learn from the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/">Data Science from Scratch</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch">Repo</a>, please check them out.

Previously I have learning machine learning models from the free Kaggle Course. Eventhough, the kaggle course is suffienct in teaching me the technicality of using machine learning models with sci-kit learn, i hope this learning project will help me more to understand the theoritical & mathematical basis of those machine learning models.
